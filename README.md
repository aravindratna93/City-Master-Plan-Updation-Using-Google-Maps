This paper describes completely how an Open Source GIS system is designed interactively to reach the obligations for the common man using all the Open Source tools required. Geoserver and Google Maps API V3 are being used to develop and deploy in this project. Keyhole Markup Language (KML) files are created according to the userâ€™s data regarding the locations and its attributes. Here Google Maps API acts as a shape file or as a base on which these KML files are hence applied to categorize the user data such as various wards, hospitals, schools, restaurants etc. in a particular city.
